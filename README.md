## Usage

The VSM GitLab Broker is published as a Docker image. The configuration is performed with environment variables as
described below.

To use the Broker client with a GitLab Enterprise deployment, run `docker pull leanixacrpublic.azurecr.io/vsm-gitlab-broker` tag. The following environment variables are mandatory to configure the Broker client:

- `LEANIX_DOMAIN` - the LeanIX domain, obtained from your LeanIX url (example if your workspace is located at `https://my-company.leanix.net` then the domain is `my-company`).
- `LEANIX_API_TOKEN` - the LeanIX token, obtained from your admin panel. :warning: Make sure the api token has `ADMIN`rights.
- `GITLAB_TOKEN` - a [personal access token](#personal-access-token) with `api` scope.
- `GITLAB_URL` - the hostname of your GitLab deployment, such as `https://gl.domain.com`. This must include the protocol of the GitLab deployment (http vs https), default is `http`.
- `GITLAB_WEBHOOK_URL` - public endpoint which resolves to gitlab-on-prem-broker. When not set, the broker won't place any webhooks.

### Personal Access Token
As part of the setup the vsm-broker requires a personal access token (PAT) with according rights to run effectively. For more details on how to create the PAT, see [GitLab's documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/16.1/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#personal-access-token-scopes).
**It is important to note that the PAT must belong to a user with admin access as this is necessary for the broker to create webhooks.**

The following scopes are required:
Gitlab Scope  | VSM Usage
------------- | -------------
`api`    | To read repository data and manage the webhook on system-level
`read_user`    | To verify the current user's permissions

### Command-line arguments

You can run the docker container by providing the relevant configuration:

```console
docker run --pull=always --restart=always \
           -p 8080:8080 \
           -e LEANIX_DOMAIN=<region>.leanix.net \
           -e LEANIX_TECHNICAL_USER_TOKEN=<technical_user-token>\
           -e GITLAB_TOKEN=<secret-gitlab-token> \
           -e GITLAB_URL=<GitLab Ent URL(https://gl.domain.com)> \
           -e GITLAB_WEBHOOK_URL=<GitLab Broker URL> \
        leanixacrpublic.azurecr.io/vsm-gitlab-broker
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Using over a http proxy system

Add the following properties on the command:

```console
docker run 
           ...
           -e JAVA_OPTS="-Dhttp.proxyHost=<HTTP_HOST> -Dhttp.proxyPort=<HTTP_PORT> -Dhttp.proxyUser=<PROXY_USER> -Dhttp.proxyPassword=<PROXY_PASS> -Dhttps.proxyHost=<HTTPS_HOST> -Dhttps.proxyPort=<HTTPS_PORT> -Dhttps.proxyUser=<PROXY_USER> -Dhttps.proxyPassword=<PROXY_PASS>" \
        leanixacrpublic.azurecr.io/vsm-gitlab-broker
```

#### Using amd64 images on Apple M1

Just run the container by providing the following command:

```console

docker run --platform linux/amd64 \
           ...
        leanixacrpublic.azurecr.io/vsm-gitlab-broker
```

## Release Process
In order to provide a excellent experience with the agent, we are using a three-pronged release process. Any change we undertake can be classified into one of the three categories:
1. **Major**
   These are releases that change the brokers behavior fundamentally or are significant feature addition. Examples could be supporting a new domain API GitLab released. As per SemVer nomenclature these wil bump the version like so `v1.0.0` > `v2.0.0`.
2. **Minor**
   These are releases that add non-breaking feature increments. Examples could be: adding new API calls to fetch further data for use in VSM. As per SemVer nomenclature these wil bump the version like so `v1.0.0` > `v1.1.0`.

3. **Patch**
   These are releases that entail hotfixes, non-breaking updates to underlying libraries. As per SemVer nomenclature these wil bump the version like so `v1.0.0` > `v1.0.1`.

With every new release you will find the details of what the release entails in the [releases tab](https://github.com/leanix/vsm-gitlab-broker/releases).

## Broker Architecture
1. The integration (vsm-gitlab-broker) is packaged as a docker container which shall be deployed on the customer premises

2. The container runs a live service, which runs continuously
   - it exposes a health endpoint on path `/actuator/health` which can be used to check the health of the service

3. On startup:
   - the service will reach out to VSM to fetch the configured GitLab group

   - the service will then call the GitLab instance to fetch relevant GitLab data

   - the service will on startup place webhooks on the GitLab instance to listen to events emitted from in-scope GitLab groups to update VSM.

   - the service ensures that there will always only be one webhook registered

4. At runtime:
   - as stated under 3) the service will listen to webhook events after the initial setup

   - to account for any intermittent interruptions (e.g. network issues, docker container failure etc.) between the agent and the GitLab instance, the service will do a full scan every week to ensure eventual consistency in VSM
